## 🧩 Project Summary

PayD is a revolutionary payroll system that enables organizations to pay employees, contractors, and partners across different countries using blockchain-based digital assets. By leveraging Stellar's fast, low-cost network, PayD replaces traditional banking rails with near-instant, transparent, and cost-effective payments.

**Key Benefits:**

- ⚡ Near-instant salary payments (seconds vs. days)
- 🔍 Transparent transaction tracking on-chain
- 💰 Lower cross-border fees (fraction of traditional banking)
- 📊 Stable-value payouts with predictable conversion rates

## 🚨 Problem This Solves

Traditional international payroll faces significant challenges:

| Problem                        | Impact                                  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| International bank delays      | Payments take 2–5 business days         |
| High transfer fees             | SWIFT + intermediary fees (often 5-15%) |
| Currency conversion issues     | Unpredictable FX rates and hidden fees  |
| Lack of proof                  | Difficult to verify payment delivery    |
| Contractor/freelancer payments | Many unbanked or prefer digital methods |

## 💡 Core Concept

Instead of routing through expensive banking infrastructure:

All transactions occur on-chain with full transparency and auditability.

## 💰 Asset Design on Stellar

PayD utilizes Stellar's asset issuance capabilities to create organization-specific stable assets:

### Example Asset: ORGUSD

- **Issuer Account**: Controlled by the organiza

## 📚 Contribution Reward (Bounty) Program

We value community contributions! High‑priority issues may carry a bounty to recognize and reward contributors.

### Eligible Contributions
- **Bug fixes** for critical bugs affecting core payroll flows.
- **Feature implementations** that align with the roadmap and have been approved as high priority.
- **Documentation improvements** that significantly enhance onboarding or user guidance for bounty‑eligible issues.

### Claim Process
1. **Work on an issue** labeled with the `bounty` tag.
2. **Submit a pull request** that resolves the issue and passes all CI checks.
3. **Add a comment** on the issue with the PR link, stating you are claiming the bounty.
4. **Project maintainers** will review the contribution. If approved, the reward will be transferred via the project's Stellar wallet.

### Reward Details
- Rewards are paid in **XLM** (Stellar Lumens) or a stable asset of the project's choosing.
- Amounts vary per issue and are defined in the issue description.
- Payments are processed within 7 business days after PR merge.

- **Salary Tracking**: View incoming payments
- **Transaction History**: Complete on-chain records
- **Balance Management**: Asset balances and values
- **Withdrawal Options**: Multiple anchor services
- **Wallet Integration**: QR codes for easy setup

### 3️⃣ Payroll Engine (Backend)

**Automated Payment Flow:**

1. Checks scheduled payments at designated times
2. Verifies employer account balance and authorization
3. Runs preflight `simulateTransaction` checks before wallet signature prompts
4. Signs and submits Stellar transactions only after simulation passes
5. Processes bulk payments efficiently
6. Logs all transactions in database
7. Sends notifications to employees

### 4️⃣ FX & Conversion System

- **Real-time Rates**: Live asset-to-fiat conversion (see our [FX Rate Fetching Logic](docs/FX_RATE_FETCHING_LOGIC.md) for details on fallback and caching architecture).
- **Anchor Fees**: Transparent withdrawal costs
- **Network Fees**: Minimal Stellar transaction fees
- **Multi-currency Support**: Support for various local currencies

### 5️⃣ Transparency & Auditability

Every payment includes:

- **Transaction Hash**: Unique Stellar transaction ID
- **Timestamp**: Exact payment time
- **On-chain Verification**: Public ledger proof
- **Audit Trail**: Complete payment history

For cloud hosting instructions, see the deployment guide:

- [Vercel + Render Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_VERCEL_RENDER.md)
- [Staging Environment Known Issues](docs/STAGING_ISSUES.md)
- [Local Contract Bootstrap](docs/LOCAL_CONTRACT_BOOTSTRAP.md)
- [Filenaming Conventions](docs/FILENAMING_CONVENTIONS.md)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** v22+
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Rust** (for Soroban contracts)
- **Stellar CLI**
- **Docker** (optional, for local development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gildado/PayD.git
   cd PayD
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   _Edit `.env` with your configuration._

4. **Database Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Using Docker
   docker run --name payd-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:15
   ```
   _Or set up PostgreSQL manually._

### Configuration

Edit `.env` with the following key variables:

```env
# Stellar Network
STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet # or mainnet
STELLAR_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/payd

# API Keys
STELLAR_SECRET_KEY=your_issuer_secret_key
ANCHOR_API_KEY=your_anchor_service_key

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### Development

**Web app (`frontend/`):**

- **Employer dashboard** — Sidebar layout and native XLM balance live under [`/employer`](http://localhost:5173/employer) (redirects to payroll). Set optional `VITE_ORG_DISPLAY_NAME` in `.env`.
- **Theme** — Light/dark preference is stored in `localStorage` under the key `payd-theme` and synced across browser tabs.
- **Issuer multisig** — Configured asset issuers (`VITE_*_ISSUER`) are checked against Horizon using the wallet’s network; payroll and cross-asset flows show a warning when multisig is required.

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Local Soroban Contracts

If you want to build, deploy, and seed the local Soroban contracts in one pass,
use the bootstrap helper:

```bash
python3 scripts/local_contract_bootstrap.py --dry-run
```

The script lives in [docs/LOCAL_CONTRACT_BOOTSTRAP.md](docs/LOCAL_CONTRACT_BOOTSTRAP.md)
and can be run with `--contract` flags to limit the scope.
