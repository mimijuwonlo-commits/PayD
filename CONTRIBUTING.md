## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. Please read and follow our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ (for frontend and backend)
- **Rust** 1.70+ (for Soroban contracts)
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose** (recommended for local development)
- **Git** (for version control)
- **PostgreSQL** 15+ (if running backend without Docker)
- **Redis** 7+ (if running backend without Docker)

### Quick Start

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PayD.git
   cd PayD
   ```
3. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Install dependencies** (see [Development Environment Setup](#development-environment-setup))
5. **Run the development server** (see [Development Environment Setup](#development-environment-setup))

## Development Environment Setup

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using Docker Compose, which sets up the entire stack (API, PostgreSQL, Redis).

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start all services
docker-compose up

# In another terminal, verify services are healthy
./scripts/docker-health-check.sh

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f api
```

**Troubleshooting Docker issues?** See [DOCKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](DOCKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### Option 2: Local Development (macOS/Linux)

#### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your local database credentials

# Install PostgreSQL (macOS with Homebrew)
brew install postgresql@15
brew services start postgresql@15

# Install Redis (macOS with Homebrew)
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# Create database and run migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

#### Frontend Setup

```bash
# From root directory
npm install

# Start development server (includes contract watching)
npm start
```

#### Soroban Contracts Setup

```bash
# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Build all contracts
cd contracts/bulk_payment
cargo build --release

# Or build all at once from root
cargo build --release --workspace
```

### Option 3: Local Development (Windows)

Windows users should use **WSL 2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with Docker Desktop:

```bash
# Enable WSL 2 and install Docker Desktop for Windows
# Then follow the Linux instructions above in your WSL terminal
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- **Formatter**: Prettier (configured in `.prettierrc`)
- **Linter**: ESLint (configured in `.eslintrc.json`)
- **Style**: Follow existing code patterns in the codebase

```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint -- --fix
```

**Key conventions:**
- Use `const` by default, `let` when reassignment is needed
- Prefer arrow functions for callbacks
- Use TypeScript strict mode (no `any` without justification)
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions and exports
- Use meaningful variable names (avoid single letters except in loops)

### Rust (Soroban Contracts)

- **Formatter**: `rustfmt` (automatic via `cargo fmt`)
- **Linter**: `clippy` (automatic via `cargo clippy`)
- **Style**: Follow Rust API guidelines

```bash
# Format Rust code
cargo fmt

# Lint Rust code
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
```

**Key conventions:**
- Use `#[derive(...)]` for common traits
- Document public functions with `///` doc comments
- Use meaningful error types (avoid generic `String` errors)
- Optimize for gas efficiency in contracts (see [GAS_OPTIMIZATION_CHECKLIST.md](GAS_OPTIMIZATION_CHECKLIST.md))

### SQL (Database Migrations)

- **Naming**: `NNN_description.sql` (e.g., `001_create_tables.sql`)
- **Style**: Use uppercase for SQL keywords, lowercase for identifiers
- **Comments**: Add migration purpose and design decisions at the top
- **Idempotency**: Use `IF NOT EXISTS` / `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses

```sql
-- Migration 001: Create core tables
-- Purpose: Establish base schema for organizations, employees, and transactions
-- Design: Uses SERIAL for IDs, TIMESTAMPTZ for timezone safety

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS organizations (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### File Naming

- **React components**: Use `PascalCase` filenames such as `PayrollScheduler.tsx`
- **Hooks and TypeScript implementation files**: Use `camelCase` filenames such as `usePayrollData.ts` and `payrollAuditService.ts`
- **Static assets and path-oriented docs**: Use `kebab-case` filenames such as `payroll-summary-icon.svg`
- **SQL migrations**: Use `NNN_snake_case.sql` filenames such as `025_add_metadata_to_payroll_items.sql`
- **Legacy areas**: Preserve the existing directory pattern unless the change is a dedicated rename/refactor

See [docs/FILENAMING_CONVENTIONS.md](docs/FILENAMING_CONVENTIONS.md) for the full naming matrix and migration guidance.

### Documentation

- **Markdown**: Use clear headings, code blocks, and examples
- **Links**: Use relative paths for internal docs
- **Code examples**: Include language identifier in fenced code blocks
- **Accessibility**: Use descriptive alt text for diagrams

## Making Changes

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicate work
2. **Comment on the issue** to let others know you're working on it
3. **Discuss major changes** in the issue before starting implementation

### During Development

- **Keep commits atomic**: Each commit should represent a single logical change
- **Write descriptive commit messages** (see [Commit Conventions](#commit-conventions))
- **Update documentation** as you make changes
- **Test your changes** thoroughly (see [Testing](#testing))
- **Keep PRs focused**: Avoid mixing unrelated changes

### Code Review Checklist
